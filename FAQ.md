What do I do if my masternode reads "new restart required"?

1. Close local wallet, delete "mncache.dat" in your %appdata%/StoneCrypto dir, restart wallet. If that did not work go on to step 2.
2. Go to VPS and type:

```
rm -r ~/.stonecrypto/blocks ~/.stonecrypto/chainstate
stonecoin-cli stop
```

3. If you used the Stonecoin MN Setup script then let sync (if not, run "stonecoind -daemon"), open the local wallet and press "start alias"
